=head1 NAME

w_of_z, im_w_of_x - Faddeeva's rescaled complex error function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<#include <cerf.h>>

B<double _Complex w_of_z ( double _Complex z );>

B<double im_w_of_x ( double x );>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Faddeeva's rescaled complex error function w(z), also called the plasma dispersion function.

B<w_of_z> returns w(z) = exp(-z^2) * erfc(-i*z).

B<im_w_of_x> returns Im[w(x)].

=head1 REFERENCES

To compute w(z), a combination of two algorithms is used:

For sufficiently large |z|, a continued-fraction expansion similar
to those described by Gautschi (1970) and Poppe & Wijers (1990).

Otherwise, Algorithm 916 by Zaghloul & Ali (2011), which is
generally competitive at small |z|,
and more accurate than the Poppe & Wijers expansion in some regions,
e.g. in the vicinity of z=1+i.

To compute Im[w(x)], the Taylor series, Chebyshev polynomials and the asymptotic expansion are used;
the accuracy is better than 2^-51=4.44e-15.
